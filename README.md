## Overview
The **Smart Irrigation Controller** is an IoT project designed to automate and monitor irrigation systems with real-time data logging. It uses the **ESP32** microcontroller with various sensors to track soil moisture, temperature, and light levels. 

**Features:**
- Real-time monitoring and control
- Web Dashboard and Mobile App built with React
- Secure communication via Netbird VPN
- Data logging and historical analysis

## System Architecture
The system comprises the following components:
1. **ESP32 Microcontroller**: Handles sensor data and controls the water pump.
2. **Raspberry Pi Server**: Hosts backend services and serves the UI.
3. **Sensors**: Soil moisture, temperature, and light sensors.
4. **Actuator**: Water pump controlled via relay module.

Here's a high-level diagram of the system:

## Software Setup
### Zephyr RTOS on ESP32
1. Install the Zephyr SDK.
2. Configure the networking stack for Wi-Fi connectivity.
3. Implement sensor drivers and control logic.

### Raspberry Pi Server
- Install Docker and Docker Compose.
- Set up Netbird VPN for secure communication.
- Develop backend with your preferred language and frameworks.

For detailed setup, see the [Software Guide](link-to-software-guide).

## Security
This project uses **Netbird VPN** for secure communication between the ESP32 and Raspberry Pi. 
- Ensure all data transmission occurs over VPN for encryption.
- API endpoints are secured with token-based authentication.

---

## User Guide
1. **Access the Dashboard**: View sensor data and control the water pump manually.
2. **Mobile App**: Install the React Native app for remote access on mobile devices.
